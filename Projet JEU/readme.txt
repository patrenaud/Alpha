A NEW WORLD - ALPHA

What's on the Alpha :

- Player and enemies instantiate for each level. Player Stats (HP, Damage, Range Attack, etc.) are ajusted depending on level gained earlier
- Enemies now have 4 States during their turn (Idle, Patrol, MoveToPlayer, Attack)	
- Map has been Upgraded (Models, Assets and Size)
- Flow Updated. If Player does not die, he can play many levels and Upgrade his Character.


How to Play :

- Same as the Prototype, the only Input needed is the left MouseButton. When Enemies are Destroyed, a Result screen appears and 
  the player can play the next Level.

- * FEEDBACK MISSING: enemy sight range for StateChange between Patrol and MoveToPlayer
- Dexterity will be revamped (Hit% will be removed from Dex stat)
